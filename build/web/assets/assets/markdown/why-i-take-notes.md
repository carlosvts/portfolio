# Why I Take Notes?

> Written in January 15, 2026

I built this section on my website to be able to store most of my notes during my programming journey, but why?

## Slowing the pace

Usually when I am learning new features and concepts, sometimes I just go to the practical part after reading/listening to some book/video. Although i found a great method -- because all the content is fresh on mind -- if I want to go back to that analysis a few days or weeks, i just don't have a place with notes written in my style.

## Better learning

In most cases, i have discovered that if i spend some time writing a markdown (like this one) after completing a project or a difficulty task I was assigned, my understanding about the concepts scales by a lot. You have to stop the all vicious speedy life to sit there and write a cohere note on how XX thing work, organize the words and paragraphs in a way that other person with zero experience can -- at least -- learn something new. That's for me isn't just a way to enhance my learning, but a way to express better a thought.
